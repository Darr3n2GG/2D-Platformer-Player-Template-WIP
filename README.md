# 2D Platformer Player Template WIP
## What this template can do:
- custom acceleration based on user implementation (AccelStrategy)
- hollow knight-like player camera (lerp and direction based camera)
- some simple platform templates

## What I am planning to add:
[Check out the feature tracker](https://github.com/Darr3n2GG/2D-Platformer-Player-Template-WIP/issues/2)

## Usage
Nodes are located in the [game_objects](https://github.com/Darr3n2GG/2D-Platformer-Player-Template-WIP/tree/main/src/game_objects) folder. Just drag and drop anything you want to use.  
Remember to also import the necessary scripts from the [scripts](https://github.com/Darr3n2GG/2D-Platformer-Player-Template-WIP/tree/main/src/systems) folder if the nodes you want to import need it.
