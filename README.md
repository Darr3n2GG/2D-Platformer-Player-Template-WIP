# 2D Platformer Player Template WIP
## What this template can do:
- custom acceleration based on user implementation (AccelStrategy)
- hollow knight-like player camera (lerp and direction based camera)

## What I am planning to add:
- Custom jump
- Jump mechanics
  - coyote jump
  - jump buffer
  - jump count (double jump)

## Usage
The player node is in the game objects folder. After importing to godot, you can configure the player to fit the feel of your game in the editor.
  
Note that the camera is not a child of the player. It is a standalone camera that you can configure.
